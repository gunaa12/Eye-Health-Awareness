            <p> Eye sight is a common issue faced by many around the world. These problems can arise from heavy screen usage - including what you are doing right now: staring at a screen -, optic fiber damage
              infections, etc. (for more information, <a href = "https://www.aoa.org/patients-and-public/caring-for-your-vision/low-vision/what-causes-low-vision">click here</a>).
              One of the biggest causes, however, is screen glare, which many programmers and UI designers are surely aware of. However,
              with enough preventive measures, many can avoid most these problems.

            <p> With many people quarantining, people are relying on their devices more than ever before. For parents, they now have to
              actively supervise their children. To avoid this and make the children happy, they give them a device. However, this excess
              screen time can lead to worse eyesight.

            <p> Along with you nose and mouth, your eyes are another frequent spot the infection uses to get through to inside our body.
              It has also been noted that COVID-19 can temporarily hurt visibility or completely blind someone. Sometimes, eyes can be used to
              detect whether a person has COVID-19 (pink eyes are associated with the infection). Although not much is known, it is possible that even tears can spread the virus.
